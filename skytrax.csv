The seats were not exactly spacious but I was fortunate enough to have a seat between me and the lady in the aisle who slept the entire journey.

Although I bought our tickets at the same time, we were on the same booking reference and checked-in together but AirAsia split us up. I was shocked and tried to speak to the flight attendants and they were lovely enough, to say it was absurd to split families. They couldn’t do much as other passengers had already paid for selecting their seats and didn’t want to swap seats. My four-year-old was upset and crying as he wasn’t able to see me. He was seated separately all the time and I couldn't be with him on this long-planned father-son trip. I was just wondering what the implications for safety are, in the case of an emergency? Don’t you think a separately seated parent like myself, would ignore all evacuation procedures in desperate attempts to be with his child? Don’t you think that little children need to be in a seat adjacent to the seat of an accompanying family member?

The sets of 3 on the last 2 rows are reserved for cabin crew to use as rest-areas which reduces the amount of noise around your seats if seated there and also increases privacy. The seat was the longest or widest making it hard to stretch out or sleep in a fetal position. You will have to step over your neighbour if they happen to be in a lie-flat position which can be painful at times. A snack bag was provided as were 2 hot meals, all of which tasted pretty good.

The seat width however was horrible. First reduced due to the tray table in armrest on top of that the remote for entertainment console is also placed in armrest and the holder pokes about an inch into the seat. Uncomfortable to get in or out of the seat and nearly impossible to reposition yourself without getting out if you are slightly on the heavier side. Better for people who feel comfortable in 16 inch seat width. The entertainment screen is folded on a swiveling arm which folds behind your feet. It was quite hard to move it into position (joints were hard) and amazingly the joint which is supposed to holed the screen upright was super smooth! At initial deployment of the screen I had just started watching something with my legs crossed over each other and the screen fell (swiveled on a horizontal axis at the bottom side of the screen) and hit my shin quite hard. For the rest of the flight I was rubbing my shin (and keeping the blanket folded many times on my leg to prevent any further injury due to the screen). I forgot to mention that the controls in the remote which was poking my thigh did not function. Not just on my seat at least 6 more seats around me had the same issue.

We could have flown Malindo Air or Jetstar for $200 per ticket cheaper but preferred Virgins flight times. Big mistake. They use an aircraft that should be on regional flights, not international flights with only enough legroom for anyone under five foot six tall. They force us taller people to upgrade to economy X at an extra cost of $69 each. Their economy X seats have the legroom of standard economy on most other international aircrafts. I have renamed Virgin's economy class to sardine class. Economy X to cattle class and anyone who fly's business class has more money than sense. None of these classes are value for money.  Then they send us emails to bid for an upgrade to their idea of business class at an extra minimum cost of $250 per seat. They have reduced the legroom of the economy seats to a ridiculous width to fit in the economy X seats at the front of the plane behind business class. The solution to me is also obvious. Take a row of economy X seats out and increase the width of the economy seats back to what they should be. They will reduce their revenue from the loss of a row of economy X seats but have happy customers in economy again.

Arriving at the Premium Economy check in was a breeze. There was no line and the next Business Class window called us over and processed our documentation. Priority boarding alongside Business Class passengers was wonderful - the FA's call you by name and introduce themselves personally. You are offered champagne, juice or water while the plane loads, then your dinner preference is taken. Our 12J/K seats were a private retreat and we loved being amongst the first to disembark at LAX. Seats were wider, the comfy blankets and a 38"" pitch made the journey a delight. Larger IFE screen, amenity kit and a feeling of reasonable indulgence was our first impression. At over $6k it was probably way more than people would justify - but to us - it was a 14 hour extension of our holiday. The 2 (smallish) dedicated PE restrooms were mostly available throughout the flight, but they were clean which was a huge bonus. Return leg was uneventful, but I hated the middle row of four seats and made sure we booked next year's flights well in advance to get window seats.

Then we scrunched in for three hours in the smallest, narrowest, most miserable airline seats. The flight attendant got all defensive and huffy when I tactfully pointed out an adult passenger ignoring the fasten seatbelt during heavy turbulence. His seatbelt was hanging into the isle. Basically, she implied it shouldn't be my concern. Having watched people hit the ceiling in turbulence, I felt it was in the interest of safety of other passengers.

0.0,0.1,"""an absolute nightmare""",2019-05-02,Australia,"China Southern Airlines were an absolute nightmare. My flight from Sydney to Guangzhou was redirected to Hainan due to ‘bad weather’ in Guangzhou. We were not allowed off the plane and had to sit and wait for 7 hours until ‘the weather cleared up’ (even though our connecting flight took off an hour before we finally arrived in Guangzhou so we think they overbooked the flight). They had to ration food and drinks because stock was limited. When we finally arrived in Guangzhou, we spent over 150 AUD on the lounge in the airport as we had to wait for another 4 hours for the new flight they put us on to Ho Chi Minh and we were exhausted and wanted to sleep, shower and eat as the airlines did not provide any facilities or food during this stopover. Because of this delay my sister and myself missed out on a full day in Ho Chi Minh. The 4 hour delay for the flight back home from Hanoi to Guangzhou causing us to miss our connecting flight to Sydney created absolute chaos. We had to wait in a queue in Guangzhou airport at 11pm with hundreds of other passengers with missed connecting flights for over 2 hours. They finally announced there were no more flights back to Australia that night and that they would process everyone one day visas and provide accomodation for the night. By the time all this was processed it was 2am and we were told we needed to be back at the airport at 6am in order to queue to be put on standby for flights back to Australia. We ended up staying in the airport all night (which we were entirely unprepared for as the airport was freezing cold and we were in summer clothes and we did not have Chinese Yuan so had to pay for tea in the morning with our Australian debit cards which gave us a terrible exchange rate and there was no free clean drinking water in the airport) and from 5:30am had to wait another 2 hours in a queue until we were told there were no more seats available for any flights back to Australia until the 1st May. This was on the 28th April (our original flight was meant to be on the 27th April). China Southern’s customer service was terrible, there was barely any communication, there were parents with children waiting in the queue and people with no access to internet as China blocks access to people without WeChat. No refunds or flights with other airlines were offered, and it was expected that you come back to the airport from your accommodation everyday to get another day visa until a flight opened up. This is when my sister and I decided to make our own way back home, which took 4 days in total. The only affordable option home was through Hong Kong, Singapore and Gold Coast. We are now 2,000 AUD out of pocket due to booking new flights and other expenses such as meals and water, data roaming and taxi fares. We are both exhausted and came down with colds due to the chilly air conditioned airports and had to take 2 extra days of annual leave. Hopefully our travel insurance covers us for all this but there were plenty people who did not have travel insurance or internet and who may still be waiting in Guangzhou for a flight back to Australia today.

Seat bsase moves forward slightly and back rest moves with it to provide a minimum but not a comfortable amount. Lower part of seat doubles as a rest for upper legs (activated by button on seat). Base of seat in front has foot rest. However the seats are so close together than when the seat is in the reclined position and the leg rest raised it is impossible- even to rest feet on for rest as it is too close. I am of short stature and I was unable to sit comfortably for this reason. I found it necessary either to have my feet supported which led to fatigue in the upper legs or to have my upper legs supported meaning that my feet were ""dangling"". Sleep was possible but only just. Lights from other passenger´ seats and screens is very intrusive and impedes sleep. Everything is very close together giving no sense of privacy. The seat rows are so close that anyone sitting away from the aisle can only exit if the passenger on the aisle seat moves which is inconvenient for all. Unlike other reviewers I did not suffer any back pain or other serious discomfort but did not feel rested. The seat I had originally been assigned to was broken- the lower left rest disengaged and rose immediately I sat down - the latching mechanism was defective. This problem could not be sorted out before departure. However I was able to move to the next seat in the row. If this had not been the case then I suspect I would not have been allowed to use the seat during take off and landing since I could not sit in the ""upright"" position. Also the raised footrest would have impeded exit of the passenger sitting in the middle seat posing a safety hazard.

They are hard. The recline is very limited when it works and the fixed head rest is too low to support the head of anyone with any height. These problems were compounded by the failure to carry extension belts which fit the short seat-belts fitted on the second and third of the three rows (I was able to use the belt on the A319 on the connecting flight without difficulty). I therefore had to be transferred to the front row. This has a bulkhead which diminishes the value of the extra leg-room when the seat is upright: when I tried to use the (limited) recline  an extension came out which pinned my feet to the bulkhead.

It was the worst flight experience I have ever had. As others have already stated, the seats were incredibly tight to sit in and reclined only slightly. The rows of seats were so close together that one had to be a contortionist to extricate oneself from a seat. In addition, it seems that the entertainment system has been retrofitted into the plane resulting in boxes on the floor throughout the cabin. If such a box is under the seat in front of you, you have lost half of the room allocated for your feet. I have flown regular economy class on other airlines many times and I have never encountered such an uncomfortable setup on an airplane. I spoke to others on this flight and all were in agreement. Our flight experience was so bad, so uncomfortable, so miserable that we will never use KLM again. My suggestion would be for the executives at KLM to sit in these seats for a long haul intercontinental flight so that they can experience the results of their decisions.",Economy Class,Boeing 747-400,3x4x3,September 2015,Couple Leisure,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,no,klm-royal-dutch-airlines,KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,0.4,,,,,,

0.0,0.1,"""the worst flight I've experienced""",2015-07-28,United States,"Been flying with KLM for over 25 years now in various classes but last experience in economy from Houston to Amsterdam was the worst flight I've ever experienced. I am about to end my long term relationship with KLM after this. I am 1.95m tall and not so thin, and was sitting with my wife and son in row 33 (all 3 seats), I was in the aisle seat. It was physically impossible for me to sit with my legs straight out in front of me there simply wasn't enough room to fit my bones between the seats, so I had to splay my legs outwards. On the outward aisle side my leg couldn't fit under the arm rest (which is fixed and can't move up) so it was digging into the top of my leg all the time. On the inside my leg was now in my son's seat space and my feet couldn't get under the seat due to the box on the floor. My son is also over 1.90m so he was already experiencing similar issues, without me using his leg room. All this was without the person in front reclining their seat.  We tried to lift the armrests to collectively give us more space, but they only go to about 45 degrees as they simply cannot fit between the seats at chest height so these were at best under my armpits. Third issue: just sitting in the seat my shoulder was touching my sons shoulder, pure and simply the seats are only as wide as a person, nothing more. Fourth issue: if my wife or son wanted to go to the toilet they had to climb over me to get out. Not ideal but if were not family this is extremely unpleasant for everyone involved. Bottom line: this is the worst long haul flight I have ever made with KLM, or any airline come to that. This has never happened to me before outside of one other (also with KLM) experience on a short haul flight (~2 hours), but for an intercontinental flight of ~10 hours this is terrible. Economy means budget and therefore maybe some discomfort, but it should never result in physical pain to anyone, or offensive intrusion of one passengers legs into another passengers seat space. In my 25 years flying with KLM this problem has only got worse, but became critical around the time KLM merged with Air France. KLM's relationship with it's passenger's has deteriorated to one of simply money - everyone buys a basic seat, but if you're tall or not thin then we (KLM) know you'll probably pay even more to get a slightly better seat. There is no concept of building a long term relationship with customers, or meeting their needs, so long as we make a few bucks out of you, we're happy even though we know you're not. Extremely short sighted and selfish attitude from a long time national carrier that should know and aspire to something better. KLM may think all its customers look at is the bottom line and that cheap is the name of the game, but if that's the case then why do they offer lots of seats at extra expense to avoid incredibly bad seat conditions.  It might surprise you to learn that if I'm going to have to pay a bit more to get a better seat then I'd be prepared to pay it up front to guarantee seat quality and comfort!

That being said, even with all the precautionary measures, I was surprised that they were still able to put a somewhat decent service together. Air Canada uses Super Diamond seats, which arrange passengers in a reverse herringbone configuration. It's a pretty standard product, though I must say I really like the colour scheme that Air Canada uses. It just looks really clean and the colours contrast nicely. Due COVID-19, I requested the upgrade to business as a precautionary measure, and I wasn't disappointed. Even with reduced cabin services, it was still a nice experience. Sure, there's no pillow or bar service- they've warned about this on their website, but as it turned out, when they said they would be serving pre-packaged meals, all they meant was that they weren't going to plate your meal for you. It was still business quality (veal from Hawksworth), but they simply didn't give you that picture perfect plating that is so greatly appreciated. Despite the lack of a pillow, the seats were still quite comfortable, though it could still do with more lumbar support, and the lack of a pillow made the sleeping position a tad awkward because my head was dipped backwards even with the power adjustable headrest. Service could admittedly be a bit more polished, though to be fair, part of this definitely has to do with the COVID-19 precautions. I should probably try upgrading again when this blows over.

0.0,0.3,"""seats are very narrow""",2018-10-27,Canada,"The most uncomfortable long haul flight I have been on. I was seated in row 38, an aisle seat on the Boeing 787-9. I am fairly close to average size (barely 6 feet tall and 185 pounds), so not tiny but neither am I a giant by any means. My knees were just about touching the seat in front of me, the seats are very narrow, and thankfully the passenger seated in the middle seat was not large but he did fill the seat and needed all his elbow room. The seats are very short, offering little or no support to the thighs. This adds to the discomfort, particularly on a long flight. I could not stretch both my legs out fully at all while seated. Trying to use some of the aisle is next to impossible due to the extremely narrow aisles. There is barely room for the refreshment carts to pass. I spent a great deal of time on the flight moving my arm and shoulder inwards as the carts and other passengers were passing and bumping into me and there was no space. Seat backs are very thin and offer no support either. Due to all the factors mentioned, I found sleep to be impossible. The passenger at the window seat managed about an hour's sleep but basically had the same complaint, and needed muscle relaxers for her back towards the end of the flight. Anyone getting out of their seats found it necessary to pull on the seat in front of them for balance and leverage. For relief, I got up to stand and stretch at the rear of the plane 3 times on the eastbound flight and 4 times on the westbound leg. Also, on the outbound flight, our connection was a little late so we went straight to board our London flight without buying snacks, etc. Be warned, we found out on board that in economy you cannot buy snacks.

1.0,0.7,"""choose seat due to extra legroom""",2017-12-10,Australia,"This review is based on exit row 31 on the Boeing 787-8. I was in seat 31J from Vancouver to Brisbane, a nearly 15 hour flight. I specifically chose this seat due to the extra legroom it provided. On this particular flight it was $150 extra to select the seat as it is classified as preferred (not to be confused with premium economy). When we boarded the plane there was a small overhead bin above our row that was able to fit all of my and my partners bags (2 backpacks, a suit bag and a shopping bag of snacks) as we were unable to store anything for takeoff. I was expecting brief instructions from one of the flight attendants on how the emergency door worked as we were right beside it however this never happened, I assume because there was a flight attendant jump seat facing us on the other side of the exit. Once the flight took off and the seatbelt sign was off we were able to get a few things from the overhead bin above and had no issues from the flight attendants storing the on the floor, we just made sure there were right against our seat so as to not block the emergency exit. The tray tables were in the armrests which made it difficult to get too if the person beside you was asleep with their arm on the opening. The entertainment screen was a folding arm below the armrest that swung up in front of you. For me it was not high enough and it did not quite sit centred in front of you which was slightly annoying.There were also 2 power supply outlets located on either side of the middle seat, nearly at the ground. I consider myself a tall with an average build (190cm 90kg, 6' 2"" 200lb) but the seats were exceptionally comfortable compared to other economy seats. The recline was average and the moveable headrest was ideal for someone as tall as I am. With the new 787s the seats recline in a way where your seat moves forward slightly when you recline the back. I can see this being an issue when you already have limited legroom, but for this seat it was a nice touch as it seemed to be more comfortable than just the back reclining. The extra legroom was the true winner though. You basically had unlimited legroom as the next row of seats was about 1.5 to 2 meters away. I could stretch my legs out as much as I want and with the unique way the seats recline I believe it was the most comfortable you could be trying to sleep in a seated position. The biggest downside was that in the centre was the washrooms, one on each aisle. Although you could not smell anything for the duration of the flight, the door was quite loud when people let is slam. Also people would line up for the washroom in the area directly in front of you.

6.0,0.9,"""seats do offer good recline""",2017-12-06,Canada,"Flight attendants aren't overly friendly, but they are helpful and attentive, walking up and down the aisles quite often. Aside from the in-flight meal, the cabin crew does come around with drinks and more complimentary snacks quite often. Because Air Canada use a 3x4x3 layout for their 777, seats may feel a bit cramped. This is particularly noticeable when you're trying to have your in-flight meals and you're bumping elbows with your neighbour (the food is good though, even for economy class standards). I consider myself to be average build for someone who is 5'8, and those seats were still reasonably comfortable. I would say however that for the seats on the middle-column, under-seat stowage is odd, since you only get 3 holes for 4 people to put their bags under, which means your neighbour's carry-on may encroach on your legroom. These seats do offer good recline, as the back reclines as the seat cushion slides forward. With the amount of leg room you get, this typically doesn't reduce your legroom dramatically enough to be uncomfortable. Seats are also quite plushy yet offer adequate back support, and the they offer an adjustable leather headrest. You will also find that throughout the flight, the new 777-300ERs feature the Boeing 787 mood-lighting which gradually changes colour throughout the flight. It looks cool and I did rest well on the flight, but there is a relationship between mood lighting and the quality of my rest has yet to be determined.",Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3,November 2017,Solo Leisure,0.8,0.8,0.6,0.8,0.6,True,air-canada,Air Canada,1.0,0.8,,,,,

We found the seats to be extraordinarily uncomfortable; little in the way of cushioning and no lumbar support. The seat pitch was terrible, they are too close together. I was unable to see or reach my belongings with my tray table down. This is particularly bad in the window seat. If you are on the aisle you can pull your belongings out to the side to reach them. If the seat in front of you is reclined it is in your face unless you recline yours too--creating a domino effect behind the first reclinee. We do not like the nickel and dime attitude of charging for seat selection ahead of time. On this flight from Portland OR to Toronto the charge is $45-46 for 'premium economy' (it did not look like seat pitch was noticeably better in these seats in front of the wing), and $21 for regular economy behind the wing. If you don't pay to choose a seat ahead of time, AC assigns you seats 24-hours ahead of flight time. Our seats were assigned by AC. We did get to sit together, but in row 30 out of 33. There is one toilet in economy class on this plane. The inside of the plane looked old and in need of minor repairs to seats and surrounds. Food and drink service was provided once at the beginning of the flight and once toward the end of the flight. Flight attendants were no-where to be seen between those times. (Probably serving in first class). USB ports at each seat, no AC outlet. Small screen on the back of the seat in front of you. A little high for me to comfortably view. But good movie selection. Under-seat storage was good, with no center divider to get in the way. Overhead bins were small, with just enough depth to accommodate a regulation size carry on placed sideways.

However, the Air Canada seating in economy class is horrible. It is so cramped that my body was aching by the time I arrived in Toronto. When I first sat down my passport dropped on the floor which I attempted to pick up but it was impossible to actually bend down. And I'm only 5.6 and of average weight. I was only able to retrieve it by having the other two passengers in my row get out of their seats. The overhead bins were full but yet there was little room under the seat for storage. My bag sat on my feet for the whole trip. Two of the passengers in the row ahead of us decided to drop back their seats right at takeoff making everything oh so lovely.

I was supposed to be in Business class on the trip to Copenhagen and I was downgraded to Premium Economy. While the services offered in Premium Economy is more than I usually receive on Delta, the seats was uncomfortable. I fly Delta Economy Plus a great deal so I will be comparing AC seats against what I am used to sitting in. While the seats on the 787 are wider, you don't have as much leg room. On a transcontinental flight I found myself getting leg cramps and a sore butt. I don't even get that in Economy! The food was okay. It was actually better than the business class main meal I chose on the return trip home. The seat recline was inadequate and to get the seat back to the upright position, you have to grab hold of the back of it and pull up. I thought I had a defective seat until I saw others doing it. The entertainment center is pretty good. My headset plug was kind of loose, but there was a little retractable knob that you can wrap the cord around to ease the tension. The seat storage was inadequate as well. There was hardly room for any of my things. The service was okay. Not as attentive as I used to receiving. I loved the big windows, I had an aisle seat and I was able to outside. On the return trip, I was in Business Class and that seat was awesome. it was a true lay flat seat.

These seats are located immediately behind a service bulkhead and afford a lot of legroom. The IFES and table tray are located in the armrests as is the remote control for the IFES and overhead lights etc. We found the trays easy to deploy but it took both arms and a lot of effort to get the IFES unit out of the armrest. When deployed it was difficult to view as it was somewhat offset by the armrest or the tray (if deployed). The remote control is on wired tether which often tangled with other items and accidentally turned lights on or off or called cabin crew unnecessarily - annoying. The seats are leather-faced and comfortable. An amenities kit is provided with pillow and blanket. The seats are close to washrooms. When cabin crew were accessing the bulkhead storage there was a tendency to hit my feet with the door. Also this is a service area for c rew so it can be noisy as can be the sounds of passengers walking to and from the washrooms. Overhead storage is plentiful. Meals were excellent as was the crew service. For overseas flights it is worthwhile paying extra for the comfort. If we had to do this again we would probably choose seats farther back in this 24-seat cabin to avoid the bulkhead closet crew activity and washroom sounds.,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,2x4x2,,,1.0,0.8,0.8,1.0,,True,air-canada,Air Canada,0.4,,,,,,

Luckily there was only two seats taken on our row because it would have been unbearable for 8 hours flying from LHR to ORD with 3 people in a row that cramped! I can honestly say that it is the most cramped economy class I’ve flown in to date (and I fly a lot) The food was ok, cabin crew were rude and officious on that particular flight, I think some cabin crew forget they are just waitresses and waiters and develop a heightened sense of self importance and they seem to forget that the passengers on that plane have paid a contribution into their pay packets. The 787 is a beautiful plane though, you do notice the difference when you land, as there is more humidity in the cabin you don’t dry out, and it’s pressurised to a lower altitude. It’s the quietist plane I’ve been on (quieter than an A380) we had very strong turbulence over Greenland but the flex in the wings soak up most of the upwards and downward shift in air flow. I’ve flown with AA about 8 times now and I’ve not had a bad landing.

Both flight into and out of HNL from LAX were at max capacity - people had to check carry on's at the gate. Leg room was very nonexistent in regular economy.  I don't see how anyone with anything but an 'average' human body could possibly fit into the seats. It was impossible to stretch my legs out under the seat in front due to my carry on bag being stored there. I am a 5'10"", 160lbs man. I was lucky enough to score window seats on both flights and propped my feet up on the back of the arm rest and cabin wall for the duration of the flight. I was careful not to annoy the person in front of me, I know this is considered highly rude. Sleep was impossible. The tray tables are the new style - they are folded in half for storage, so they're kind of flimsy. I could not fully extend my laptop screen to use it during the flight. The seat in front of me was simply too close! I had to work up the courage to recline my seat. I was afraid of discomforting the passenger behind me. Recline makes the tray table inch awfully close to the person behind you if they are using their seat tray as well. The cushion of the seat was adequate for me. The seat pocket is useless for storing anything other than magazines, a bottle of water and/or book will not fit. Flight attendants were very warm and nice so that made up for the physical discomfort. Took some time to get beverage service initially distributed to all passengers. The flight in only offered water after the 1st service. The flight out offered full beverage service multiple times during flight. Seat entertainment was pretty good. And the screens do have privacy filters in case there are children seating next to you. Seat-to-seat messaging was cool. But the actual software was a bit laggy for 2017 but functional. Also, in flight wifi is useless. Don't waste your money unless you have hours of emails to respond to. Bathrooms were very clean. Also, on the flight in the pilot flew over all the islands and identified them by name - it was an amazing descent into Honolulu that I will always remember. The flight out from Honolulu offered stunning views of Diamond Head and Oahu but did not fly over the other islands. Flew the same aircraft from LAX-DFW in the middle seat - horrible. No place for my arms. Constantly fidgeting. It was miserable. I could not wait to get off that aircraft. Do not store your carry on under the seat in front of you if you can.

AA should modernize the premium cabin in all their 737 planes as it is similar or worse to what other carriers call big front seat: being not that big or wide and not having a leg rest. Instead of going forward in terms of coping with premium cabins they are going backwards with all the other things that have being removed such as no meals in many flights 3 hour or less, no blankets, no pillows, etc. It is getting to a point that flying routes of up to 5 hours is similar a seating in a theater seat that after the first 1.5 hrs of the movie, one does not find a position, and no matter how hard one tries it feels very uncomfortable.",Premium Economy,Boeing 737,2x2,February 2016,Business,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.6,no,american-airlines,American Airlines,,0.6,,,,,

These fees were so that we could sit together for the flights and for extra leg room. We never got the extra leg room on any of the 4 flights and had to argue with the counter people to even get to sit together. For example, when checking in with AA mobile app (which doesn't work well) for our flight from Honolulu to Phoenix, the app showed our assigned seats as being available for an extra fee (which we had already paid). We were then assigned standard seats (no leg room) and 6 rows apart. Finally, we got a counter agent to at least sit us together for the flight but we were told that this was a ""different plane so seats were different"". If this was even true, isn't it good business to take care of those that paid extra for better seats and then assign remaining standard fare seats? It appears that American charges at least double for this bait and switch. Who knows how many ""extra"" fees they charged for special seating and then assigned standard seats? We know for a fact that they did so on the HNL to PHX flight, as we spoke to the people occupying our originally assigned seats. The flight to Honolulu was so bad that my arm was cramped against the cabin wall resulting in numbness for most of the flight. As a result of not having room to stretch my legs for me, as a diabetic, resulted in my ankles swelling terribly on both 6 hour flights.

(Our trip was 6.5 hours) I think the discomfort is on purpose because they will sell you an upgrade which gives you 4-6"" more legroom than the regular seats have. I had to upgrade because I became nearly claustrophobic thinking about having to climb back into that confined space. And tho the legroom helped and the fact that I was on the aisle instead of in the middle the seats were so narrow that I came off the plane with a six inch bruise from the armrest.

I chose Lufthansa based on value for money; the same applies for Premium Economy. A standard economy seat was £500 and PE was £800. The price gap was so reasonable compared to other airlines (particularly BA and Virgin) that I thought I'd opt for the additional comfort. The initial Premium Economy experience doesn't differ from Economy. There are no airport perks, no priority check in etc; however, the substantial difference comes when you embark. The seats are akin to a domestic/pre-lie flat business class seat with a wide chair, leg rest, deeper than normal incline and in seat amenities. As a bonus I also chose an end of aisle seat so I had slightly more leg room, and of course the added bonus of no one inclining in to me! The additional service includes food service on crockery instead of out of cartons, glasses instead of plastic cups, metal cutlery, a menu with meal choices and an arrival drink. All of these are minor touches, however they all add up to enhancing the passenger experience. The amenities kit that comes with the seat is simple and welcomed; an eye mask, a tooth brush, travel socks and a face wipe all I a personalised pouch. Other additions include a blanket and pillow on arrival.

I was in seat 27G which is the second row of Economy seats now the reason for the extra legroom is the fact that the plane layout goes from a 2x3x2 to a 2x4x2 in row 27. Seat G is basically halfway in the aisle. however the rest of the row is god awful because the seats aren't perfectly aligned and therefore every seat has immovable armrests for tray tables but the video screens are still on the seat in front giving a very crooked view. Honestly it is the most aggravating thing. Another huge reason for the low score is the bathrooms. Lufthansa has a neat little feature where they place all economy bathrooms downstairs on the bottom deck. This is really cool however there are only 5 of them. The flight attendants also have to guard the stairs to make sure that crowding doesn't occur. They vigilantly stand guard and make sure a line of no more than 5 people forms (which happens rather quickly).

The seats have an ethernet jack and USB port but NO power sockets. Wifi is available at a small price; but using Wifi uses much more battery power in your laptop. Unless you're very lucky with battery life having no power socket is a serious disadvantage especially for cost conscious business travelers - but then again Lufthansa would like to see those in Business class anyway which isn't always possible. This negates the advantage of having Wifi available. The inflight entertainment system has an OK range of films and programmes. You can normally find 4-5 hours of viewing from the selection. The system however is quite slow and the touchscreens very temperamental. If you want more then bring a tablet computer with a long battery life loaded with films and avoid Wifi.

The cabin was the new refreshed one and it was kept in a very clean state with all equipment in working order and the seats are nice and comfortable. The adjustable headrest is also a plus in terms of comfort. I am quite tall at 5ft 10 and the legroom can't be beat, even with my backpack under the seat in front of me, I had room to stretch out and relax and my legs didn't hurt. Excellent cabin service as always with kind and courteous flight attendants and entertainment options as well and power outlets are avaliable to charge your devices. The complimentary Wi-Fi was fast and I experienced no dropouts for the entire duration of my flight from MIA to EWR. I am flying on JetBlue again this August and I recommend this airline to anyone looking for a affordable airline with more comforts than even the legacy airlines such as American Airlines. I would also like to commend customer service for their help because when I was booking my latest flight, I somehow got two tickets when I am a solo traveller and they took care of the issue and I got credited back any points used after the site experienced issues when this occured and even was able to score my favourite seat for both my return and destination trips after this issue was corrected.

We arrived at the airport and went to the check-in counter to speak with someone. The lady there told us that there is nothing to do if we don't upgrade our seats for an 80$ fee as it looks like we bought the last two tickets and these were the last two places. When we arrived to the gate the gentleman there said ""please come here if you don't have a seat assigned on your ticket in order to give you one"". And that was the moment I realized we were fooled by this company. We went there and asked, how can we have bought the last 2 tickets in this aircraft and have the last two spots in the middle if there are people with no seat assigned? And he just told me “I said you can upgrade for 80$, if you don’t just have a nice trip, bye”. They were rude and impolite, they didn’t solve our problem and it was clear that they have a software that automatically assigns you and your partner far apart just to upgrade and pay more money. None of us was assigned at the window or the aisle because it’s harder to switch places in the aircraft with someone if you are assigned in the middle (if one of us would have had aisle or window seat would have been much easier).

Although seats don't recline and the person at the front won't lean back and occupy your limited space hard shells are not comfortable when compared to other ordinary seats and I don't feel relaxed at all. These seats should not appear on an aircraft of a 5-star airline. If Cathay wants seats that do not recline so much and occupy one's place at the back maybe they could choose ordinary seats that could recline but with a max angle fixed so as to reduce effects on the person at the back.. On the other hand seat legroom was just acceptable not satisfactory enough and seat width was good just like other Cathay aircraft.

First 10 hours to HK were okay pretty on par with other major airlines and no complaints about the A300 seat comfort access or configuration. However the A340 shell seats are hard uncomfortable and the worst I've sat on. The fact that the seat doesn't recline from your hips and merely slumps you downwards putting an immense amount of pressure on your lower back and bottom is terrible for getting any kind of sleep rest or even just general comfort. I'm average height and small build but I can only imagine with horror what this might feel like for taller or bigger built people. When slumped in the seat there then appears a large gap between the paper thin seat padding and the headrest causing further spinal issues with no support for your head neck and shoulders. As a final insult the seat belts have an airbag in them which makes one side of the belt extremely bulky quite weighty and cumbersome so that even just sitting upright never mind trying to sleep is uncomfortably restricted by this bulging leather strap. There's also limited leg room under the seat in front not sure why but it's probably the fault of the shell seat design being so low to the floor and there's also very limited space in the seat pocket annoying when you can't fit much under the seat either. The only saving grace this aircraft design has is the configuration. I was travelling with just one other person and it was nice to just sit in a twosome without fear of the dreaded middle seat or clambering over a stranger while they sleep to go to the restroom.,Economy Class,AIRBUS A340,2x4x2,,,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,,no,cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways,0.2,,,,,,

At two hours (on a 15 hour flight) the seat became noticeably uncomfortable. My legs became numb from pinched circulation at about 3 hours. The new 6 inches recline is nice when you are sitting in it but intrudes greatly into the space behind you. The unpredictability of a 2 to 6 inch recline creates stress. Your knees get banged laptop knocked off the tray table etc. And your personal space and privacy is mostly in control of the whim of the passenger in front of you. Also the thinner and lighter seat material makes for a smaller seat footprint which amplifies the loss of privacy when the person in front or to your side reclines.

Specifically, our family had the centre group of four seats immediately in front of the galley. None of us are tall, so leg room is not a problem. We had two problems which applied to all four seats: 1. the seats don't recline very far; 2. in-flight entertainment problems: a. the entertainment handsets didn't work. We could not activate reading lights, call staff button, control the screen (volume, program, menu, etc. )or play games. b. volume control buttons at the bottom of the screens didn't work. c. touch screens weren't calibrated properly. We soon figured out we had to touch above, or to the right of the desired selection. d. screens wouldn't tilt. When the row in front reclined, we couldn't see the screens properly because our seats didn't recline to match and the screens were pointing down. Because of the problems above, I gave up on in-flight entertainment soon after take-off and pulled out a book. Unfortunately, once the cabin lights were turned off, I had to give up on that as well because there was no way to activate the reading light.

On these journeys and on previous SQ journeys, I've flown Premium Economy. I am not at all impressed with the design of the seats. They're not particularly comfortable. Leg room could be OK with ingenuity. The folding trays slotted between the seats often cause all sorts of inconvenience to passengers and staff since they have to be stowed ""just so"" or they don't stow without awkwardness and delay. The lid covering the trays has no obvious lifting point or slot or button or ... On the 380 there were two buttons below the cover that had nothing to do with the cover but which seemed that they might do. I pressed one. A sort of thigh/leg support appeared. It was not wanted. I pressed retract. Nothing happened so there we were stuck with a half-projected support for the rest of the flight. Then there's the point for insertion of the head phone plugs - to the side and behind the passenger. A meal arrives, the tray has to be extracted and later retracted. And then there's a nice mix up of headphones cable , tray table, tray and confused passenger. Then there's the prissy little ""pocket"" on the back of the seat in front that may need to contain a laptop, an ipad, a documents gag, the free bottle of water and some medications. Well, well. Good luck with that - after a sick bag, a Kris world magazine, a Kris Flyer magazine, an emergency procedures card all have prior place. The floor has then to make do for head phone cover, amenities bag and newspapers and magazines that the profligate passenger may have had the lack of foresight to bring. Then try finding the medications with cabin lights out at 4 am without disturbing the sleeping neighbour by turning on the overhead light. All is darkness. No doubt SIA paid millions for this design.

1.0,0.3,"""seats are very shallow and flat""",2018-11-23,United Kingdom,"Having had an outbound journey with Singapore Airlines in business class, we came back in premium economy, and the difference could not be more stark! While the base spec of their premium economy offering appears on paper very similar to many others, we were very disappointed when comparing them to, for example, Virgin. The seats are among the most uncomfortable we had ever sat in, making the 13.5 hour flight to London from Singapore a real test of endurance. To put this into perspective, the economy seats we had on Singapore Airlines sister carrier Silk Air for an earlier connecting flight were exceptionally comfortable! The use of a solid centre divider between each pair of seats means you are hemmed in (they claim 19.5 inches width, but I think its more like 17!) and achieving any diagonal recline is very hard. The seats are also very shallow and flat, meaning that when reclining you start to slide off - not helped by a bizarre thigh support pop-out and ridiculous footrest, when don't work together well at all. The seat needs to be more bucket shaped to be in any way comortable, and a 2x3x2 format would help achieve a more premium feel. Legroom is also deceptively similar to economy. All in all, we were very disappointed, and given that at current prices, you can find upgrades to business class on LHR-SIN return for about 35-40% additional, we'd rather do that.

As for the seating itself economy class is not as comfortable as I expected with the seats feeling somewhat smaller and more cramped then the cozy older generation seats in the SQ B777-200 that flies from Singapore to Manila. The entertainment system food customer service however were all excellent on all my SQ flights. Being a rather small asian framed person I think it would be quite difficult for a 6ft European to travel long distances in the SQ A380 economy class but I doubt any other carriers would offer anything better without having to pay for business class. In terms of seat width legroom and access these seats felt no better than the Jetstar A330 that also flies Melbourne-Singapore. All in all I would probably take SQ again on my next business trip to Asia given their competitive pricing at the moment (SQ is at least $300 cheaper than Philippine Airlines when travelling between Aus and Phil).

The flight left late because there were a lot of passengers who did not stick to their allocated seats and one that somehow made it to the door without their boarding pass. Dirt was noticeable everywhere even on the bright orange uniforms. Cabin crew were particularly noisy in the galley and I often felt them bumping against the board in front. What was particularly bad in terms of customer service however was that there was only 1 magazine for seats 1A to 1F and although initially I was lucky to have it the head cabin crew snatched it from my pocket without asking to check the price of a blanket for a rear seated (and less entitled passenger) and never returned it even though I never had a chance to read it.,Economy Class,A320,3x3,March 2019,Solo Leisure,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.6,no,jetstar-airways,Jetstar Airways,,,,,,,

There is little equality in this booking class - Row 1 seems reasonable whereas Rows 2 and 3 seem like cages. A colleague in Row 3 experienced similar problems as I did: her seat reclined only part way and when the seat in front was fully reclines, she was unable to escape the fact that the seatback was so close to her face that eating a meal became an exercise in contortion.

The flight to Denver left on time, but the return flight (leaving at 9:55 p.m.) was delayed for about 4 hours because of a mechanical problem. To their credit, Frontier brought in a new plane and new crew rather than just cancel the flight and they gave us a travel voucher. The seats on the A320 were the most uncomfortable seats I've ever experienced on an airline. Or anywhere else for that matter. It is difficult to imagine anyone in the Frontier front office approving these seats for installation after sitting in them. They don't recline, they have a ridiculously small tray table and they are extremely uncomfortable -- like sitting on a thin blanket placed on a hard bench. The seats are so uncomfortable that I would have to seriously re-consider ever flying Frontier again -- even with the free travel voucher. Our flight was relatively short, but a longer flight sitting on these ""seats"" is unfathomable. I suspect Frontier did a cost analysis in which they factored in the lost revenue from people like me who won't fly Frontier again because of these seats vs. the additional revenue gained from packing more sardines into the can. I think Ford probably went through the same type of monetary analysis years ago with the gas tank on the Pinto.

Row was so narrow that it was difficult to navigate to the seat without tripping. Once I finished my meal, I asked the flight attendant if she could please dispose of the sack. She snarkly replied that I would have to keep it on me until she could get around to it. Okay, that wasn't until nearly an hour and forty-five minutes into the flight! Flight crew were not very friendly and appeared to me to be exhausted. Decided not to interact with them the remainder of the flight! Return Flight: Departed PDX slightly behind schedule due to a delayed push-back from the gate. Again, crew looked exhausted but was friendlier this time. Again, park bench-hard seats, no leg room, only two working lavatories (one in front, one in back, one broken), noticed nine tenths of the overhead warning lights (No Smoking, Seatbelts) were not working, cart only made one trip during entire flight, crew seen grabbing the $50.00 seats for themselves and sleeping (this was a ""Red-Eye""). Only good seats are in the forward cabin area and cost an extra $50.00 to get, small bottled water and coffee is $3.00, everything else is between $7.00 & $9.00, couldn't even get a free glass of water to take prescribed medications!

Also on-board the staff was friendly and service was great. The problem starts with the plane: the A340 seats are very old and were updated with an entertainment system. In reclined position you can hardly see the screen and have to change into an uncomfortable position if you want to use the entertainment system. If you want to work, however, the situation is worse. When the person in front of you reclines her seat, you cannot even fit a laptop between you and the seat in front of you, let alone placing it on the tray table so you can actually work. This leaves you with the option to sleep. However, this is also not possible as the seats are incredibly uncomfortable for a long distance flight. So finally you are left with reading a book, if you brought one, which means disturbing the other passengers with your reading light. If you are of a rather less antisocial nature you are left with staring at the ceiling for 12 hours. The complete lack of comfort in economy also has an impact on the situation on board: people will start walking around, when the person behind you or in front of you moves they will automatically hit your seat and wake you up if you have managed to fall asleep in the first place. I was woken up five times. Conclusion If you can avoid it do not fly long distance with Swiss.

You are not given any amenity kit, but they do provide a blanket - no pillow.

I was dreading this flight after reading the reviews, but it wasn't bad. Premium economy is definitely worth the additional money for this flight. The cabin is broken up into a smaller segment of 5 rows, there is a wall, and another cabin area which I thought was also Premium Economy, but the seat chart says it is economy.

At the time of booking I checked emergency exit seats were available on all flights and all seats at emergency exits were available. I am 6’2” and anyone 6’ or over will know the discomfort experienced in a normal pitch seat. BA had prices on all seats so you could reserve the seat you wanted, the seats at the emergency exits where you could see there was more space for your legs were 3 times the price of a normal seat. I paid additional fees for 8 seats at emergency exits. I receive emails from BA in July 2018 to say they had changed my seating allocation but I presumed they had just moved us to another exit seat on a like for like basis. If not I was expecting a refund, the refund never came, so I remained confident we were still seated in a like for like basis. Out of 8 emergency exits seats I paid for, we were only seated in 3. Upon my return I requested a refund from BA for 5 seats I’d paid for at a premium rate, below is their response. Thanks for getting in touch with us about your flight from Manchester on 22 November. You’re clearly disappointed with your seat because it didn’t have as much leg room as you’d expected. I completely understand why you’re feeling let down. I realise you feel you didn't get the seats you'd paid for. The maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board our flights. We can’t guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website, as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you’re travelling on. I’m afraid we can’t promise you’ll be able to sit in a particular seat on our aircraft and we do advise this in our General Conditions of Carriage, which you accept when you make your booking. This means I’m unable to offer you a refund on this occasion. I know this isn’t the answer you were hoping for and I’m sorry. I can see why you’re frustrated we didn’t meet your expectations and we’re grateful you've taken the time to let us know how you’re feeling. Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to respond to your concerns. We appreciate your support as a Blue member of our Executive Club. I hope we can welcome you on board again soon. Please feel free to contact me directly using the blue link below if I can help you with anything else. I emailed them back stating I’d paid a premium for extra leg room seats by emergency exits and I expected a refund and this was their reply. I'd like to inform you that we do inform passengers that the seat map is for guidance only and not true to scale. Extra space between rows does not indicate extra legroom. However, any exit row seat may have extra leg room, but we don't sell these seats as extra leg room seats on ba.com. The leg room may vary as per the aircraft seating configuration. I do appreciate your reasons for asking, I'm afraid we cannot refund you the prepaid seating charge. So basically, BA believe if they do not sell seats as extra legroom seats, they can charge you a premium for them, then move you to a seat you’d pay less for and not refund you the difference. The scale argument does not stand up to scrutiny as the seat pitch at emergency exits are more than standard pitch.",Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x3x3,December 2018,Couple Leisure,0.2,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,no,british-airways,British Airways,0.4,,,,,,

The seat itself was quite comfortable, with a good seat pitch and a decent recline (we were in the back row so didn't need to worry about ruining someone else's journey by reclining into their faces). The seats had seen better days, and the whole cabin looked quite old and tatty. The screens on the back of the seats in front were tiny and quite difficult to see. In my case it was not functioning correctly anyway, but I'd brought my own entertainment so not really a problem. There was the - now usual - problem of people bringing up to five bags onboard, some of which were large suitcases, so very little room in the overhead lockers for those who'd only brought on one bag. Since our bags fitted under the seat in front this was not an issue. The biggest problem was the meal service. There were theoretically two meal options but since we were at the back of the cabin we were left with the option nobody else wanted: they called it ""spinach and ricotta ravioli"", but it was an inedible slab of dried up pasta and dried up tomato ketchup. On the plus side for us, the first choice, ""Fillet of beef with broccolini"", was also barely edible. In my experience economy gets much better meals than premium economy on most airlines. If travelling premium economy on British Airways, where one of the options is inedible slops, those at the back of the cabin will effectively get no meal because the travellers at the front get first choice. If you're travelling from London you can choose your meal beforehand, which is useful.

As we made our way onto the plane (from near the front of the general boarding queue), my perfectly average not heavy not oversized bag (we also had checked baggage) was taken from me to be put in the hold. I don’t know why they selected me as they then allowed practically the rest of the plane to board with their bags. I didn’t have luggage locks - my wife had them and she had boarded in front of me - and when i got on board my wife became upset because her jacket with her wallet had been in my bag because we couldn’t carry everything. She told a surly stewardess with dark hair who couldn’t have cared less. My wife questioned why my bag was taken when people with more luggage than us we being let on and the plane wasn’t completely full and she just said they’re wasn’t enough locker space. Why penalise those who arrive early at the check in then?? We’ve had stuff stolen from hand luggage placed in the BA hold before - which we mentioned to zero interest from the staff. The surly woman then proceeded to bang into my wife throughout the flight as she marched her M&S laden trolley up and down, touting the expansive tat you can buy for much less on the ground. The payment system now means those on the aisle are stuck with someone’s rear end in their faces for much longer as purchases are made, plus trolleys left in the aisle while something is heated up in the galley and trotted back out. The bags that were placed in the hold appeared very last at the baggage claim, adding to our stress. Luckily the wallet was untouched. We fly business as a family numerous times to Australia each year and we never choose BA because of the generally rubbish service on short haul flights.

The only positive was that the earphones provided worked well on my phone and the noise cancelling removed most of the inflight noise.

The AB side of the aircraft are served first for everything so you have a better chance of getting the meal of your choice on that side of the aircraft rather than the JK side. All seats are much much better than normal economy and definitely worth paying the extra for the premium ecnomy (world travelller plus as BA call it) especially if you can get seats in the pairs of AB/JK rather than the 4 in the middle.

0.0,0.4,British Airways customer review,2014-10-27,United Kingdom,I am a seasoned business traveller and on long haul flights I tend to use Premium economy if available. Usually the extra cost is about £500 and I try to use points and money to further upgrade but that is usually a lottery and not often successful. I followed a similar procedure with a BA flight form LHR to JNB on an A380 and was in premium economy on the upper deck at the front bulkhead so leg room was not a problem but the seat itself was very disappointing compared to other BA flights I have been on in essence it was a an economy seat with more leg room and a worse than useless leg rest which did not come up far enough to support your legs comfortably. In addition BA are missing a trick as these 7 bulkhead seats could have a small food rest attached to the bulkhead so you could stretch your legs out completely. A further premium could be charged I am sure not dissimilar to the practise of many airlines. In future on this route I will save my money and fly economy as I did not see a £500 premium in the seat £300 tops.

0.0,0.7,British Airways customer review,2014-10-27,United States,"We were in WT+ seats 23 A and B from LHR to SEA. On this 777-300 we had the ""new"" World Traveler Plus seats. The seats are a step up from the shabby WT+ seats on the 747-400 we had on our outbound flight. The seats were ""slimline"" with very little seat padding and poor lumbar support. Probably the best feature of the new WT+ seat is the larger AVOD monitor built into the back of the seat in front. The new AVOD system is far superior especially the moving map function. There is a foot rest that drops down from the seat in front; it's nice but doesn't add much to the experience. Lavs (just two of them one on each aisle) are located just aft of the WT+ cabin and are shared with the main WT cabin; otherwise you have to hike back to the very rear to make use of the lavs there. Like other BA long-haul aircraft the 777-300 does not have passenger air vents above the seats in WT or WT+. Because the cabin temperature is kept at near-sauna levels the lack of vents can make the trip very very uncomfortable. Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is that leg-room is restricted by two metal equipment boxes under the seats in front. The boxes restricted the ability to stretch legs and effectively prevented storing any carry-ons under the seat in front. While the new WT+ has its short-comings it is still far superior to anything offered by US carriers as a premium economy product. For us the positives were worth the cost belong regular WT and in any event the cost of WT+ was far less than what we would have paid for Club World.",Premium Economy,BOEING 777-300ER,2x4x2,,,0.6,0.8,0.6,0.8,,True,british-airways,British Airways,1.0,,,,,,

The seats were the old WT+ and showed their age in all respects (worn dirty etc); the AVOD monitor for seat 29J was so badly scratched and smeared that it was difficult to watch anything. The cabin was unbearably warm; be aware that BA's long-haul fleet evidently do not have seat air vents - so no way to keep cool. Seat 29K has no seat in front of it which makes leg room excellent and also allows for easy access to and from the seat to the aisle and area around the exit door. Seat width is poor and the seat has function buttons (and AVOD controls) on the inside of the arm rest making access and use very difficult. While it's true that the cost of WT+ is far less than the cost of Club World there is a big difference in seat comfort and the ability to get any real rest/sleep.

(How do they get steel knives through security?) The main benefit though is that there were lots of empty seats while coach on this flight from CPT to LHR was full. The biggest let-down is the tiny low-res TV screen.

0.0,0.7,British Airways customer review,2013-01-01,United Kingdom,LHR-JFK-LHR. Outbound flight my wife and I were stuck with two seats on the left of a four seater in the middle of Economy - not great and leg room was poor (especially when seat in front reclined). On return sector selected two seats together during online check-in at the rear of Economy where the aircraft narrows - meaning the configuration switches from 3x4x3 to 2x4x2. Much more legroom and plenty of storage space - plus decent accessibility. Generally the seats on the BA 747s are reasonably comfortable and have a clever adjustable headrest which provides good neck support. The seats are not the new slim-line versions used by other carriers and so have decent padding. Definitely adequate for a 7 hour flight - but am sure on long flights to HKG SIN SYD or NRT discomfort could become an issue. Both B747s we traveled on must have been over 15 years old but in good shape - clean cabin and toilets etc. No issues with food and service was good (although an observation - BA don't tend to station cabin crew in the Economy cabin during boarding to assist passengers with luggage / finding seats etc - unlike Middle-Eastern / Asian carriers). Only real issues were overcrowding at BA's Terminal 7 as JFK and the IFE screen very small. BA charge a extortionate amount to pre-book seats prior to online check in opening. Best advice is to just complete online check-in early to ensure best seat selection.,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,,True,british-airways,British Airways,0.6,,,,,,

The base seat is quite thin and hard and far too small both in width and depth. If you are sitting in the upright (non-reclined position) the front edge of the seat cuts into the underside of your thigh restricts blood circulation and eventuality becomes quite painful. As other passengers have also commented about these seats I ended up having to use the blanket to pad the seat and wrap it around the forward seat edge to lessen its cutting into my thigh. In the fully reclined position the flat bed is not long enough for people of my height so I have to settle for it semi reclines with my feet resting on something placed on the floor. This was not just a problem on the A380, I had the same sort of seat and same discomfort on the smaller planes operated to Hong Kong.

Given there was not a spare next to each one it would mean £60 per flight, £120 1 way and £240 total for the basic right of sitting next to your partner. Th original flights cost £1200 so it's an extra 10% so sit together, not acceptable at all. For clarity, it was 1 booking and checked it as 1. I can understand sometimes you get 1 aisle, then the next aisle seat but we had opposite sides of the plane (9 seats apart and 1 row in front, some several rows apart and non anywhere near each other) yet when I looked at paying to move I could see that a good 75% of the aircraft was selectable i.e free. It's also worth noting 2 of the flights were only 60% full on take off so this was clearly not an issue with a fully booked plane I've added some screenshots as proof of what is simply a crooked way to get more money from customers who have already paid a decent price for the flight in the first place. The black seats are the seats we were allocated, all the blue are the ones free. This was only half the aircraft, the other half had all seats free to select.

0.0,0.1,"""one of the worst airlines""",2018-11-06,United Kingdom,"Hands down one of the worst airlines I've travelled with. We booked with Etihad because we made the assumption they were a premium airline with a high service level therefore worth the price. We were wrong. Budget airline service at premium prices. The outward leg of this journey from London-Singapore via Abu Dhabi was vastly worse than the return. The seats are very cramped. My seat was broken on both legs meaning I could not recline and when the person in front did, I was left with 6 inches between my face and their seat back. Both myself and my partner left both flights incredibly dehydrated - we had to ask multiple times for water (it is NOT acceptable to serve liquids only twice in 7 hours, especially not when you insist on filling the thimble sized cups only halfway). After asking a second time for liquids, the cabin crew ignored and subsequently turned off my partners request button before getting annoyed when he went to the galley to ask. To say the food was revolting is an understatement. No menus are provided on board and the staff do not describe the meal past ""chicken, lamb or vegetarian"". Dinner consisted of a rock hard bread roll, a bone dry cous cous 'salad' (not that there were any vegetables in it) and in my case some dry pasta with a small amount of tomato sauce and a dry cake - apparently vegetables are not part of the Etihad service. What a come down after having experienced food on Emirates or Malaysian Airlines! The snack comprised a hot pastry before we disembarked. Food on the second flight was no better - bland cold noodle salad then ""Spicy chicken noodles"" which was actually more slimy than spicy and a snack comprising a rock hard bread roll with a smear of mystery filling. The second leg from Abu Dhabi to Singapore was a source of greater annoyance as it was announced that we would be delayed AFTER they had boarded us, probably by an hour or something (90 minutes eventually sat without water). We had onward transport arranged and were trying to figure out if we would still make it. Questioning the passengers around us it turned out that our tickets all had different scheduled arrival times on them and the crew had no idea what our original landing time should have been. If you want extra snacks between meals then good luck - in line with budget carriers you have to pay extra for this! Given how much the flight tickets are, this has to be a joke. One wonders if this is why the food is so poor - to encourage people to buy extras. The entertainment system is another source of annoyance - endless advertisements and announcements which interrupt it for 5 minutes at a time. Screen pop ups advertising snacks or duty free are also extremely irritating. The system does not start up until you've been in the air for 30-40 minutes and then shuts down 40 mins to an hour before you land, mostly without warning. Charging for seats up until 24 hours before the flight departs also seems tight - some of the seats cost £60 to reserve. That's obscene. I discovered on the return leg (Singapore - Abu Dhabi - London) that delayed departures are so common for Etihad that their scheduled flight and arrival times are essentially meaningless, having spent another hour sitting on the tarmac at Abu Dhabi for no apparent reason. This was our first time travelling with Etihad and it will certainly be our last. Appalling, careless service at inflated prices.

This is a problem when eating during turbulence as any liquid will almost certainly slide off the tray - this happened to me! The seat area is very draughty and cold - maybe just the bad flight I was on. The distance between the seat and the window is large meaning several pillows are required to bridge the gap (and support your head). I do not recommend paying extra for this seat unless you are over 6 foot tall and will benefit from the leg room.

There is a handy storage compartment on the back of the seat in front, and the screen is a reasonable size. Entertainment is plentiful and the screen is slightly unresponsive.

The 787-9 is missing a window around row 33/34 (or seat 38 in the 40-row version), but actually, when both seats are reclined, everybody gets a bit of window. I travelled in the exit row window, 28A, and the same applies — you see a little when reclined. The escape chute was not too “bothersome” however the general wall curvature around that area makes the A/B seats even squashier than usual laterally and I wouldn’t choose it again. That’s the real pity about these planes: instead of 8 across, most airlines have crammed 9, making the 787 synonymous with extremely narrow seats. The 34 inch pitch is brilliant though (hence my rating) — if you can be certain you’ll be flying in a 787-9; my leg HND—CDG which was scheduled as a Boeing 787-9 when I bought it suddenly got a Boeing 787-8 substituted and legroom was unbearable as soon as you reclined your seat.

I flew Spirit coming home from a trip in which I flew in with JetBlue (which has always been my favorite). JetBlue gave me a bit of a hassle because my ticket was booked under my married name and all my IDs are still in my maiden name (whoops!). But when I arrived early to change my boarding pass with Spirit, they were nothing but cheerful and helpful. They changed it with no problem and gave me no attitude or anything (whereas I received a few huffs and eye-rolls from JetBlue). I was still nervous about my seat. When I finally boarded the plane the seats looked normal. My seat was  clean, despite a couple of stains on the tray table. No big deal. No tv on the back of the seat, but I had downloaded a couple movies on my phone. You have to pay for food, but whatever. I think water and soda was like $3, and the snacks were around there. I'm between 5'7"" and 5'8"" and around 145lbs and found my seat to be comfortable. Or, I'll say this: I was equally comfortable on this seat than I was on my JetBlue seat. Both flights were about 5 hours, and sitting on anything for that long is bound to make your bum a little sore. I was able to stretch my legs out underneath the seat in front of me sort of, and rest my head on the window. I even slept! Going into this flight I thought I'd never fly Spirit again. Now I know I will. JetBlue will probably always be my gold standard (free food!!), but Spirit is a close second.

The Air China premium economy seats are reasonably comfortable with an adjustable footrest and the seat recline seems to be in line with other airlines, in addition the amenity kit was ok for premium economy (slippers, toothpaste/brush, ear plugs and eye mask). However, it was the service which let them down. First of all, the wifi was awful, not only did it never work, but you can only connect one device and you’re stuck with that device for the whole flight without being able to switch from phone to laptop for example. I requested wine with my meal, but they only offered soft drinks or beer, they told me wine would be served after the meal once they cleared the trays away, in what world are they living? Breakfast: you would normally expect something along the lines of yoghurt, pastries/bread, fruit, eggs. But no, for breakfast the choice was Pasta with cheese, or chicken with rice. Again, in what world are they living? I know the Chinese hate sweet stuff, and when they try to make anything sweet it’s normally awful, but they can at least make an effort to try and accommodate their non-Chinese passengers a little better. Meals were served on cheap plastic trays with plastic cutlery which is in contrast with a lot of Premium Economy with other airlines that provide it on porcelain.

Plus limited recline, circa 30 degrees from vertical, upon which when the person in the seat in front of you is reclined you have even less space to maneuver in and out and are pretty much forced to recline yourself to retain a semblance of spacing. Added to which the seat controls, such as they are, for recline, footrest, lumber massage are really stiff mechanical leavers (no electronic adjustment) so for example to recline push hard back on the lever then physically push the seat back. For a brand new plane absolutely abysmal! In addition there is literally no in flight entertainment system, at least in the seat backs. In business one is issued with an iPad which can stream movies etc. through the Silk Air WiFi. This does not support Internet connectivity, only the IFE. If you want to use your own device you need to have previously installed the Silk Air app from the app store - something nobody tells you before you board. In the cramped seat space there is very little place to put the iPad, even on the little plastic prop available on request, so one ends up holding it whilst also trying to juggle a meal or whatever. No noise cancelling headphones, just cheap in-ear buds issued and recovered, so I plugged my own noise cancellers in to the iPad. No capability to connect via Bluetooth of course. I found it impossible to doze let alone sleep on the 4.5 hours midnight flight so tried to pass the time with the limited selection of English language films on the iPad.

To have to upgrade to board first is ridiculous. We were in group C with grab any seat that is left splitting up your party. With that said there is no managing of the seat arrangements. So with 3 seats on each side, couples will take the isle seat and window seat with their carry on's in the center seat and not willing to give it up. My daughter had to argue with a man on the plane about it. Fortunately his girlfriend moved to the center seat. There were other unhappy people that ran into the same situation. The open seating is fine but needs to be managed better. If at all possible I will NEVER fly this air line again.

Seating and legroom are just as good as (and sometimes better than) the legacy carriers. If you're seeking more legroom, look for a 737-800 or 737-MAX. These planes have a 32 inch pitch instead of 31 inches on the 700s. The ""Evolve"" seat comfort is adequate.

I told her that there was no assigned seating, therefore she couldn't hold the seat. My husband decided to proceed to another seat because he didn't want to argue. I stayed in the window seat, and her friend finally showed up and sat in the middle seat. The airline needs to stress that purses are not to be placed in empty seats as a placeholder.

The footrest, whilst well intentioned, was also a disaster of design. Because it was the base of the seat opening out it meant the front of the seat was solid, so no opportunity to put heels under, to take a bit of body weight. And the foot rest was very shallow, so only heels sit on it and it doesn't go forward far enough so your feet are never in a natural position. Far better when the foot rest is attached to the seat in front. I usually enjoy a flight and it was the final part of my holiday, unfortunately I could not wait for this flight to end.

Neither is evident with this flight, which I can only describe as horrible. I have flown other very long flights, but never have I had less legroom than on this flight. Boeing shows the 777 in a comfortable-appearing 2-3-2 configuration. But this flight uses a 3-3-3 configuration with what appears to be the least possible spacing between rows. I am 5'11"" and I could not sit straight. Airlines need to publish a ""comfort index"" for any flight longer than 5 hours - a guide that takes into account the configuration (or seat width) and row spacing. This flight would score a Zero.

Another advantage is that you enter passport control into Europe in Iceland which saves time when you arrive at your final destination. Our only experience where this did not apply was for a flight to London where we had to go through passport control again. On this last trip from Boston to Stockholm, the first leg was on a recently acquired, used Boeing 767 that had also been recently refurbished. The seats that they put into the aircraft are the most uncomfortable we have ever encountered. The second leg was on a 757 and the seats were a bit more comfortable With added traffic, Keflavik is grossly undersized for the number of people in there at any one time.

The seating has ample padding, but if you are seated in the first row, either side of the aircraft, you will find a lack of footrest, which can make it uncomfortable for a tall person - having that lack of footrest, causes an uncomfortable recline to the seat. Three of the four aircraft I flew on my trip, this was the case, with the one aircraft, being an upgraded model, had cubbies at the foot of the bulkhead, which you could stash a backpack and keep your feet there if you are tall. Also, sitting in the first row, means that your entertainment system is stashed in the armrests, which are always very warm, due to the systems being confined inside. Depending on an older or newer aircraft, will depend on whether your In-Flight entertainment system functions well. The pop-out drink tray at the front of the armrest section can and will get stuck, so you will then be lacking space for drinks, which can spill very easily on the above drink trays in front of the armrests. The USB ports for charging, well they charge very slow.

Arrived at boarding and were told that the seats we had been given were allocated to someone else they had to change us again - argued as we required extra leg room which had been paid for - finally found these. On return arrived at Male airport to check in - seats had been allocated to another party - we would have to be moved - extra legroom not available as flight full - asked for confirmation of all this and staff said that he would give this to us at the boarding gate. He did give us the documentation but also we were informed that the people who had booked the seats that we had booked had not turned up so we could have them - put 2 and 2 together and get the answer that we were the people that had not turned but!! but we had and were told that the seats were taken by others. What a joke. On the plane on the short haul it took over an hour to get a drink and food and then on the long haul it took over 2 hours before the cabin crew asked if we wanted a drink and our evening meal, over night flight then the lights went out not crew to be seen they had gone into the hold and were sleeping! 2 hours before landing they then appeared with breakfast and asked if we wanted a drink.

All quite fine, except for the newer A321s from tailsign TC-JSN onwards carrying the Thales Avant IFE system on board. Of course it's pretty awesome to see a 3D view of the plane on the flight stats channel, but why do they have to come with huge boxes for the IFE under the seat in front of you?  If you're lucky to have a seat with one of those things waiting for you, be prepared to sit misaligned for the whole flight and - if you have big feet plus it's a window seat - to squeeze your feet over each other in the little space left between the IFE box and the cabin wall. Also forget to use the IFE boxes as a footrest, they come with sharp edges and you'd also kick the person sitting in front of you in the back. So to stay safe, try to avoid the A321 as they're currently getting more and more of those planes.

In the rear economy cabin, under seats B, D and J you find big boxes for the inflight entertainment, under seats A, E, F and K you find huge ones. Only the G seats come with sufficient legroom. While the big boxes do reduce the legroom, the huge boxes leave only room for one foot (no room for the left foot under A and E seats, no room for the right foot under F and K seats). Didn't check the forward economy cabin, so maybe the position of the IFE boxes is a bit different. The boxes don't have sharp edges so you can put a foot on them. Besides, there are footrests installed, but only in front of the IFE boxes. So at every seat you find a misaligned footrest for only one of your feet, depending if the IFE box is on the right or left side of the seat in front of you. When folded up, the footrest bumps against you knee (also just one of your both) when the person in front of you reclines the seat. Needless to say that these notorious IFE boxes make it impossible to somehow sit comfortable - you have the choice between one foot up, one down or sitting misaligned with your feet over each other. What a remarkable coincidence that on my flight today I had a seat with a huge IFE box (full flight, so no other seats avaliable), but the IFE itself wasn't working at all. Had another flight on an A330-300 earlier this year and didn't have a bad experience with the IFE boxes there - they also have different seats in these aircraft.

On the A380, Row 42 is the second row from the front on the lower deck, meaning there is no middle set of seats, just the forward stairs going to the upper deck (business and first class seats). Also, being forward of the wing and engines mean it's a quieter part of the cabin. The seat width is sufficient for the 7 hour journey between London and Dubai. Legroom is just about ok, but when the seat in front is reclined, you do have to make an adjustment if you are watching the tv screen. Screen is a good size, and the ICE entertainment system offers a vast selection of movies and box sets to keep you occupied. A good plus is that these films can be started immediately, so you can start your entertainment while the aircraft is still preparing for departure. However, we were surprised that the cabin crew come round to collect the headsets prior to landing. My advice is always travel with your own headsets (and adaptors). There are charging ports available so if you are using your own equipment, you won't run out of juice. Food and drink is complimentary (as is expected from an airline of this standard). However, the meal choice was the same as offered on the same route in 2013. Would have thought the menu could have been changed in three years. On the Boeing 777, Row 46 is five rows from the rear of the aircraft and as such, is the first Row where the layout reduces from 3-4-3 to 2-4-2. If you are travelling as a couple, the side seats on Rows 46 to 49 are the ones to aim for (Row 50 suffers from being too close to the galley and toilets). Seats are fine in width, but as they have three seats in front, you can angle your legs across to get more legroom. So a definite plus there. We had booked the same rows for our return flights.

This might have eaten into the already slim seat width a bit but it did not bother me being 5'8"" and average size. Another con to being at the very back of the plane is that it takes a long time to deplane and they were out of the meal I wanted by the time they got to me. 28A was just fine but only because there was no one in the middle seat next to me. Originally there was and after the doors we closed the FA came and found him an aisle seat to move to.

It seemed no more in volume than one would get in Economy. Only difference is that it was presented better with a plate and white linen. Cabin crew were unable to provide sliced lemon for my tea and sandwiches offered were dry and curled up at the edges. This is not how Business Class should be experienced.

In short this was the worst airline we have ever travelled on. Trip started well with a one up upgrade to premium economy and you can see why ANZ has done well in this category. However as we opted for the sky couch for the main leg you cannot bid for an upgrade and this is where ANZ really lets itself down. Pictures of the sky couch look very impressive however the truth is different. Dont know if they use tiny people but there is no way a small adult and 2 kids (of any age) can fit unto this space. Having 4 people in our family there was a need for another seat on the other side of the aisle. Economy seats for a so called international airline are the worst Ive ever seen. No width breadth or recline - simply terrible. Having to endure this on the return leg we decided to opt to bid for premium economy, however we had to give up a sky couch so that wasnt a tough decision. Saying that and having to endure the waiting timed via the customer service team who had on average a waiting time of 1 hour+ on 4 separate occassions, to place a bid because apparently no one ever had done this. Anyway our bid went through and the email confirmation stated that we'd hear 3 to 7 days prior if we'd be successful or not. When we heard nothing with 3 days to fo we called and were informed that we would now not hear anything till between 9 and 7 hours prior to the flight. With 7 hours to go we received an email stating we'd been unsuccessful and we'd lost the opportunity to rebook 2 sky couches (plan b) because we'd left it too late. Also due to protestors at LAX we were asked to arrive early because of potential disruptions. So resigned to the fact that we'd be flying back economy we were buoyed by the fact that our Auckland to Melbourne flight had been upgraded. However after arriving 4 hours early and dropping off the car we needed to walk 30 mins to the international airport. ANZ arent to blame for this of course, however the cabin crew were 3 hours late which is interesting considering they told us about the issue and all the passengers were on time. As a result connecting flights were missed, with no recompense in Auckland for those delayed. Our next flight was 8 hours later (currently writing this fron Auckland airport) and no airport lounge access was provided or upgrades given. To add in sult to injury we lost our premium economy upgrade, will need taxi fare to get home and have wasted a day of our lives.

Next: “the comparability of seats is open to interpretation.”  Even a computer, and certainly a person, could have found “comparable seats” - they are obviously the two-across seats at the back of the plane, the seats for which there is an extra $100 charge!

0.0,0.8,"""not sure it's worth the extra cash""",2015-11-21,United Kingdom,"Booked the Air New Zealand sky couch as an experiment on an overnight flight to try for some sleep due to a planned long-drive after landing. While the leg room on the Air New Zealand Boeing 777-300 seemed reasonable, the 3x4x3 layout means the seats are very narrow and the aisles even narrower. The sky couch option is offered in one section of the three seat layout and really, you should think of it as buying the third seat for extra room. The couch works by a section of each of the three seats hinging upwards to fill in the gap between your seat and the back of those in front. Note that this feature means that when you’re not using the sky couch set-up, the seat design means the seat has no gap behind your calves so you can’t tuck your legs in. Also when you hinge the seats back down, then anything on the floor (like your shoes) is pushed below your seat and you can’t get to them! Going back to the use of the couch there are two main problems. The first we expected, in that if you’re over about 5 feet tall, you need to bend your legs to fit into the space you’re got. However the second was not really advertised, in that there’s simply not enough space for two people to lie down side by side. The problem is at your hips – we’re in our early fifties and I’d say normal sized adults by modern standards. However the very limited space means you really are crammed together – there’s no chance at all of moving around if one of you gets uncomfortable and there’s a real scramble to get up for a toilet visit – and it’s nearly impossible to get your temperature right. Add to that you’re lying across three seats (even with the thin mattress they give you) then there are bits sticking in you meaning two people have almost no chance of getting a long period of sleep. We actually had a little more success with one of us sitting up and the other using the two seat space. A previous reviewer commented that if the seat in front reclines then it really affects the space you have – we found this wasn’t really an issue if you also reclined your seats – effectively everything cancelled out. So at an extra cost of £299 to buy the spare seat to convert to a sky couch (on this flight – I assume it varies) then I’m not sure that it’s worth the extra cash, but it does buy you a spare seat for extra room.",Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3,November 2015,Couple Leisure,0.8,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.6,True,air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand,0.4,,,,,,

While the seats themselves were nice and comfy the one downside is that if you have your seat up and the person in front reclines you have a TV screen inches from your face which made for a incredibly uncomfortable journey. On the return trip we tried the skycouch (2 adults travelling) and there is much improvement depending on what you want to use it for. We reclined the seats back and put it into 'bed' mode. For us this was fine as my girlfriend was happy to sit upright in the isle seat which allowed me to lay across the 3 seats. The extra width was lovely and made for a far more comfortable journey (even for my girlfriend who was now able to put her feet up also. The people in front did not recline giving us more space but the problem would still exist with the screen being close if they had and because of this I think if 2 people were to lay side by side with the seat in front reclined it would make it more like a coffin for one person. Saying that if you want to take turns with laying out then I would highly recommend paying the bit extra for have more sitting/laying options and generally more comfort.
