We were not allowed off the plane and had to sit and wait for 7 hours until ‘the weather cleared up’ (even though our connecting flight took off an hour before we finally arrived in Guangzhou so we think they overbooked the flight). They had to ration food and drinks because stock was limited. When we finally arrived in Guangzhou, we spent over 150 AUD on the lounge in the airport as we had to wait for another 4 hours for the new flight they put us on to Ho Chi Minh and we were exhausted and wanted to sleep, shower and eat as the airlines did not provide any facilities or food during this stopover. Because of this delay my sister and myself missed out on a full day in Ho Chi Minh. The 4 hour delay for the flight back home from Hanoi to Guangzhou causing us to miss our connecting flight to Sydney created absolute chaos. We had to wait in a queue in Guangzhou airport at 11pm with hundreds of other passengers with missed connecting flights for over 2 hours. They finally announced there were no more flights back to Australia that night and that they would process everyone one day visas and provide accomodation for the night. By the time all this was processed it was 2am and we were told we needed to be back at the airport at 6am in order to queue to be put on standby for flights back to Australia. We ended up staying in the airport all night (which we were entirely unprepared for as the airport was freezing cold and we were in summer clothes and we did not have Chinese Yuan so had to pay for tea in the morning with our Australian debit cards which gave us a terrible exchange rate and there was no free clean drinking water in the airport) and from 5:30am had to wait another 2 hours in a queue until we were told there were no more seats available for any flights back to Australia until the 1st May. This was on the 28th April (our original flight was meant to be on the 27th April). China Southern’s customer service was terrible, there was barely any communication, there were parents with children waiting in the queue and people with no access to internet as China blocks access to people without WeChat. No refunds or flights with other airlines were offered, and it was expected that you come back to the airport from your accommodation everyday to get another day visa until a flight opened up. This is when my sister and I decided to make our own way back home, which took 4 days in total. The only affordable option home was through Hong Kong, Singapore and Gold Coast. We are now 2,000 AUD out of pocket due to booking new flights and other expenses such as meals and water, data roaming and taxi fares. We are both exhausted and came down with colds due to the chilly air conditioned airports and had to take 2 extra days of annual leave. Hopefully our travel insurance covers us for all this but there were plenty people who did not have travel insurance or internet and who may still be waiting in Guangzhou for a flight back to Australia today.

I am about to end my long term relationship with KLM after this. I am 1.95m tall and not so thin, and was sitting with my wife and son in row 33 (all 3 seats), I was in the aisle seat. It was physically impossible for me to sit with my legs straight out in front of me there simply wasn't enough room to fit my bones between the seats, so I had to splay my legs outwards. On the outward aisle side my leg couldn't fit under the arm rest (which is fixed and can't move up) so it was digging into the top of my leg all the time. On the inside my leg was now in my son's seat space and my feet couldn't get under the seat due to the box on the floor. My son is also over 1.90m so he was already experiencing similar issues, without me using his leg room. All this was without the person in front reclining their seat.  We tried to lift the armrests to collectively give us more space, but they only go to about 45 degrees as they simply cannot fit between the seats at chest height so these were at best under my armpits. Third issue: just sitting in the seat my shoulder was touching my sons shoulder, pure and simply the seats are only as wide as a person, nothing more. Fourth issue: if my wife or son wanted to go to the toilet they had to climb over me to get out. Not ideal but if were not family this is extremely unpleasant for everyone involved. Bottom line: this is the worst long haul flight I have ever made with KLM, or any airline come to that. This has never happened to me before outside of one other (also with KLM) experience on a short haul flight (~2 hours), but for an intercontinental flight of ~10 hours this is terrible. Economy means budget and therefore maybe some discomfort, but it should never result in physical pain to anyone, or offensive intrusion of one passengers legs into another passengers seat space. In my 25 years flying with KLM this problem has only got worse, but became critical around the time KLM merged with Air France. KLM's relationship with it's passenger's has deteriorated to one of simply money - everyone buys a basic seat, but if you're tall or not thin then we (KLM) know you'll probably pay even more to get a slightly better seat. There is no concept of building a long term relationship with customers, or meeting their needs, so long as we make a few bucks out of you, we're happy even though we know you're not. Extremely short sighted and selfish attitude from a long time national carrier that should know and aspire to something better. KLM may think all its customers look at is the bottom line and that cheap is the name of the game, but if that's the case then why do they offer lots of seats at extra expense to avoid incredibly bad seat conditions.

I am fairly close to average size (barely 6 feet tall and 185 pounds), so not tiny but neither am I a giant by any means. My knees were just about touching the seat in front of me, the seats are very narrow, and thankfully the passenger seated in the middle seat was not large but he did fill the seat and needed all his elbow room. The seats are very short, offering little or no support to the thighs. This adds to the discomfort, particularly on a long flight. I could not stretch both my legs out fully at all while seated. Trying to use some of the aisle is next to impossible due to the extremely narrow aisles. There is barely room for the refreshment carts to pass.

Seat backs are very thin and offer no support either. Due to all the factors mentioned, I found sleep to be impossible.

376,376,1.0,0.7,"""choose seat due to extra legroom""",2017-12-10,Australia,"This review is based on exit row 31 on the Boeing 787-8. I was in seat 31J from Vancouver to Brisbane, a nearly 15 hour flight. I specifically chose this seat due to the extra legroom it provided. On this particular flight it was $150 extra to select the seat as it is classified as preferred (not to be confused with premium economy). When we boarded the plane there was a small overhead bin above our row that was able to fit all of my and my partners bags (2 backpacks, a suit bag and a shopping bag of snacks) as we were unable to store anything for takeoff. I was expecting brief instructions from one of the flight attendants on how the emergency door worked as we were right beside it however this never happened, I assume because there was a flight attendant jump seat facing us on the other side of the exit. Once the flight took off and the seatbelt sign was off we were able to get a few things from the overhead bin above and had no issues from the flight attendants storing the on the floor, we just made sure there were right against our seat so as to not block the emergency exit. The tray tables were in the armrests which made it difficult to get too if the person beside you was asleep with their arm on the opening. The entertainment screen was a folding arm below the armrest that swung up in front of you. For me it was not high enough and it did not quite sit centred in front of you which was slightly annoying.There were also 2 power supply outlets located on either side of the middle seat, nearly at the ground. I consider myself a tall with an average build (190cm 90kg, 6' 2"" 200lb) but the seats were exceptionally comfortable compared to other economy seats. The recline was average and the moveable headrest was ideal for someone as tall as I am. With the new 787s the seats recline in a way where your seat moves forward slightly when you recline the back. I can see this being an issue when you already have limited legroom, but for this seat it was a nice touch as it seemed to be more comfortable than just the back reclining. The extra legroom was the true winner though. You basically had unlimited legroom as the next row of seats was about 1.5 to 2 meters away. I could stretch my legs out as much as I want and with the unique way the seats recline I believe it was the most comfortable you could be trying to sleep in a seated position. The biggest downside was that in the centre was the washrooms, one on each aisle. Although you could not smell anything for the duration of the flight, the door was quite loud when people let is slam. Also people would line up for the washroom in the area directly in front of you. At one point in the middle of a deep sleep a gentleman tripped over my legs as he was waiting in line and fell right on top of me!

Aside from the in-flight meal, the cabin crew does come around with drinks and more complimentary snacks quite often. Because Air Canada use a 3x4x3 layout for their 777, seats may feel a bit cramped. This is particularly noticeable when you're trying to have your in-flight meals and you're bumping elbows with your neighbour (the food is good though, even for economy class standards). I consider myself to be average build for someone who is 5'8, and those seats were still reasonably comfortable. I would say however that for the seats on the middle-column, under-seat stowage is odd, since you only get 3 holes for 4 people to put their bags under, which means your neighbour's carry-on may encroach on your legroom. These seats do offer good recline, as the back reclines as the seat cushion slides forward. With the amount of leg room you get, this typically doesn't reduce your legroom dramatically enough to be uncomfortable.

We found the seats to be extraordinarily uncomfortable; little in the way of cushioning and no lumbar support. The seat pitch was terrible, they are too close together. I was unable to see or reach my belongings with my tray table down. This is particularly bad in the window seat. If you are on the aisle you can pull your belongings out to the side to reach them. If the seat in front of you is reclined it is in your face unless you recline yours too--creating a domino effect behind the first reclinee. We do not like the nickel and dime attitude of charging for seat selection ahead of time. On this flight from Portland OR to Toronto the charge is $45-46 for 'premium economy' (it did not look like seat pitch was noticeably better in these seats in front of the wing), and $21 for regular economy behind the wing.

The flight in only offered water after the 1st service. The flight out offered full beverage service multiple times during flight. Seat entertainment was pretty good.

My friend and I managed to get joint seats on one side of the plane. Legroom was fine though the seats were kind of narrow and thinly padded. Our flight back on a Boeing 747-8, however, was a nightmare all thanks to the seats being even narrower, the legroom non-existent, no to mention these metal boxes attached to the floor right under the seat in front of you, which reduced your legroom even more. Initially I got bulkhead seat (18F) in the 4-seat row. If you think the regular seats are narrow, wait until you see the bulkhead ones. Because the armrests are fixed your legs are literally squeezed. I looked behind me and there was a vacant middle seat to which I moved right before take off. But that didn't do it either. I called the staff to ask for an upgrade to the Premium Class but it cost 399 euros. So my colleague, who had an aisle seat on the same row, was nice enough to trade places with me so I could have a little more room. But sleeping is out of question on such seats.

There's just no way to get comfortable. For an 8 hour flight from LAX it makes sleeping difficult even if the seat is all the way reclined.

I pressed retract. Nothing happened so there we were stuck with a half-projected support for the rest of the flight. Then there's the point for insertion of the head phone plugs - to the side and behind the passenger. A meal arrives, the tray has to be extracted and later retracted. And then there's a nice mix up of headphones cable , tray table, tray and confused passenger. Then there's the prissy little ""pocket"" on the back of the seat in front that may need to contain a laptop, an ipad, a documents gag, the free bottle of water and some medications. Well, well. Good luck with that - after a sick bag, a Kris world magazine, a Kris Flyer magazine, an emergency procedures card all have prior place. The floor has then to make do for head phone cover, amenities bag and newspapers and magazines that the profligate passenger may have had the lack of foresight to bring.

To put this into perspective, the economy seats we had on Singapore Airlines sister carrier Silk Air for an earlier connecting flight were exceptionally comfortable! The use of a solid centre divider between each pair of seats means you are hemmed in (they claim 19.5 inches width, but I think its more like 17!) and achieving any diagonal recline is very hard. The seats are also very shallow and flat, meaning that when reclining you start to slide off - not helped by a bizarre thigh support pop-out and ridiculous footrest, when don't work together well at all. The seat needs to be more bucket shaped to be in any way comortable, and a 2x3x2 format would help achieve a more premium feel. Legroom is also deceptively similar to economy.

I could change my meal option without a problem on the phone, although I booked through a third-party website. Also on-board the staff was friendly and service was great. The problem starts with the plane: the A340 seats are very old and were updated with an entertainment system. In reclined position you can hardly see the screen and have to change into an uncomfortable position if you want to use the entertainment system. If you want to work, however, the situation is worse. When the person in front of you reclines her seat, you cannot even fit a laptop between you and the seat in front of you, let alone placing it on the tray table so you can actually work. This leaves you with the option to sleep. However, this is also not possible as the seats are incredibly uncomfortable for a long distance flight. So finally you are left with reading a book, if you brought one, which means disturbing the other passengers with your reading light. If you are of a rather less antisocial nature you are left with staring at the ceiling for 12 hours. The complete lack of comfort in economy also has an impact on the situation on board: people will start walking around, when the person behind you or in front of you moves they will automatically hit your seat and wake you up if you have managed to fall asleep in the first place.

Having 9 seats in each row is quite a lot in reality, it can result in some armrest battles with your neighboring passengers from slightly narrow seats. Maybe 8 would have given a better customer experience.

Although I had booked Economy I was allowed to move due to free places. Therefore, my review refers to the premium seats. The aircraft was of medium age and the seats and the floor of the cabins looked clean, but had slight signs of wear. The seats in economy class are very narrow. However, they are good in the higher class. Especially since the price isn't much higher. You have to consider that it is a cheap airline. Anyway, I could sleep well although I didn't figure out how to adjust the seat. I am 6 feet tall and could sit normally in the premium class. This was not possible in economy class. The width of the seats seemed to me sufficient. So who is big and wants to fly with this airline should book Premium. Or the flight is so short you can withstand the inconvenience.

At the time of booking I checked emergency exit seats were available on all flights and all seats at emergency exits were available. I am 6’2” and anyone 6’ or over will know the discomfort experienced in a normal pitch seat. BA had prices on all seats so you could reserve the seat you wanted, the seats at the emergency exits where you could see there was more space for your legs were 3 times the price of a normal seat. I paid additional fees for 8 seats at emergency exits. I receive emails from BA in July 2018 to say they had changed my seating allocation but I presumed they had just moved us to another exit seat on a like for like basis. If not I was expecting a refund, the refund never came, so I remained confident we were still seated in a like for like basis. Out of 8 emergency exits seats I paid for, we were only seated in 3. Upon my return I requested a refund from BA for 5 seats I’d paid for at a premium rate, below is their response. Thanks for getting in touch with us about your flight from Manchester on 22 November. You’re clearly disappointed with your seat because it didn’t have as much leg room as you’d expected. I completely understand why you’re feeling let down. I realise you feel you didn't get the seats you'd paid for. The maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board our flights. We can’t guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website, as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you’re travelling on. I’m afraid we can’t promise you’ll be able to sit in a particular seat on our aircraft and we do advise this in our General Conditions of Carriage, which you accept when you make your booking. This means I’m unable to offer you a refund on this occasion. I know this isn’t the answer you were hoping for and I’m sorry. I can see why you’re frustrated we didn’t meet your expectations and we’re grateful you've taken the time to let us know how you’re feeling. Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to respond to your concerns. We appreciate your support as a Blue member of our Executive Club. I hope we can welcome you on board again soon. Please feel free to contact me directly using the blue link below if I can help you with anything else. I emailed them back stating I’d paid a premium for extra leg room seats by emergency exits and I expected a refund and this was their reply. I'd like to inform you that we do inform passengers that the seat map is for guidance only and not true to scale. Extra space between rows does not indicate extra legroom. However, any exit row seat may have extra leg room, but we don't sell these seats as extra leg room seats on ba.com. The leg room may vary as per the aircraft seating configuration. I do appreciate your reasons for asking, I'm afraid we cannot refund you the prepaid seating charge. So basically, BA believe if they do not sell seats as extra legroom seats, they can charge you a premium for them, then move you to a seat you’d pay less for and not refund you the difference.

1523,1523,0.0,0.5,"""seat itself was quite comfortable""",2018-09-17,United Kingdom,"I travelled from Houston to London Heathrow in premium economy. The seat itself was quite comfortable, with a good seat pitch and a decent recline (we were in the back row so didn't need to worry about ruining someone else's journey by reclining into their faces). The seats had seen better days, and the whole cabin looked quite old and tatty. The screens on the back of the seats in front were tiny and quite difficult to see. In my case it was not functioning correctly anyway, but I'd brought my own entertainment so not really a problem. There was the - now usual - problem of people bringing up to five bags onboard, some of which were large suitcases, so very little room in the overhead lockers for those who'd only brought on one bag. Since our bags fitted under the seat in front this was not an issue. The biggest problem was the meal service. There were theoretically two meal options but since we were at the back of the cabin we were left with the option nobody else wanted: they called it ""spinach and ricotta ravioli"", but it was an inedible slab of dried up pasta and dried up tomato ketchup. On the plus side for us, the first choice, ""Fillet of beef with broccolini"", was also barely edible. In my experience economy gets much better meals than premium economy on most airlines.

The aircraft was dirty with a thick layer of dust between the window seat and the cabin wall. There were cup ring marks on the arms and the seats were the most uncomfortable I think I have sat on for a long flight of nearly 9 hours in any class including economy. The cushion area was devoid of any 'cushioning' and the seats were worn and old looking. The TV had a screen not much bigger than my mobile and the quality was so poor I decided that I would use my phone and listen to the music for the entire trip home. This is the first time I have ever felt that I could not tolerate the poor screen quality. I had to wear my glasses just to try and follow the on screen commands. The only positive was that the earphones provided worked well on my phone and the noise cancelling removed most of the inflight noise. At a time when BA seem to be moving away from their prestige airline image that has been their selling point for many years I really can not understand why customers travelling long distances should have to be transported in such awful planes. My only serious satisfaction is that I did not accept the offer to upgrade to business.

Now they charge you (even their loyalty card holders!) if you are travelling without a checked in bag & want to change the terrible seat they have assigned you.

And on every occasion the seats have been assigned to us at the very rear of the plane, and every time without a window seat. They've done this despite plenty of free seats being available in the mid & front of the plane. There is only 1 reason - they do it specifically to force you to pay for a seat change. Have a look at the seat map from todays flight that I have attached. Despite there being numerous free seats around, they've put us at the back of the plane and on both sides of an aisle so we cant even talk together comfortably. And I was checking in only a few minutes after the online check in opened - so there was no lack of available seats. There are some other airlines also charge for seat selection, but normally they are low cost carriers. British Airways charges premium fees for its seats and is a national carrier. This is pure greed. If you don't take a checked in bag, you are saving BA money. So why should they punish you in return? They save time/money on loading the plane - on staff at the check in desk - on downtime at the gate - on risk due to terror hype - on paying to replace lost baggage and  belongings and on fuel due to less weight etc. They should reduce the ticket price, not increase it!

1630,1630,0.0,0.4,British Airways customer review,2014-10-27,United Kingdom,I am a seasoned business traveller and on long haul flights I tend to use Premium economy if available. Usually the extra cost is about £500 and I try to use points and money to further upgrade but that is usually a lottery and not often successful. I followed a similar procedure with a BA flight form LHR to JNB on an A380 and was in premium economy on the upper deck at the front bulkhead so leg room was not a problem but the seat itself was very disappointing compared to other BA flights I have been on in essence it was a an economy seat with more leg room and a worse than useless leg rest which did not come up far enough to support your legs comfortably. In addition BA are missing a trick as these 7 bulkhead seats could have a small food rest attached to the bulkhead so you could stretch your legs out completely. A further premium could be charged I am sure not dissimilar to the practise of many airlines. In future on this route I will save my money and fly economy as I did not see a £500 premium in the seat £300 tops.

The seats are a step up from the shabby WT+ seats on the 747-400 we had on our outbound flight. The seats were ""slimline"" with very little seat padding and poor lumbar support. Probably the best feature of the new WT+ seat is the larger AVOD monitor built into the back of the seat in front. The new AVOD system is far superior especially the moving map function. There is a foot rest that drops down from the seat in front; it's nice but doesn't add much to the experience. Lavs (just two of them one on each aisle) are located just aft of the WT+ cabin and are shared with the main WT cabin; otherwise you have to hike back to the very rear to make use of the lavs there. Like other BA long-haul aircraft the 777-300 does not have passenger air vents above the seats in WT or WT+. Because the cabin temperature is kept at near-sauna levels the lack of vents can make the trip very very uncomfortable. Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is that leg-room is restricted by two metal equipment boxes under the seats in front. The boxes restricted the ability to stretch legs and effectively prevented storing any carry-ons under the seat in front.

Much more legroom and plenty of storage space - plus decent accessibility. Generally the seats on the BA 747s are reasonably comfortable and have a clever adjustable headrest which provides good neck support. The seats are not the new slim-line versions used by other carriers and so have decent padding. Definitely adequate for a 7 hour flight - but am sure on long flights to HKG SIN SYD or NRT discomfort could become an issue. Both B747s we traveled on must have been over 15 years old but in good shape - clean cabin and toilets etc. No issues with food and service was good (although an observation - BA don't tend to station cabin crew in the Economy cabin during boarding to assist passengers with luggage / finding seats etc - unlike Middle-Eastern / Asian carriers). Only real issues were overcrowding at BA's Terminal 7 as JFK and the IFE screen very small. BA charge a extortionate amount to pre-book seats prior to online check in opening.

1710,1710,0.0,0.1,"""one of the worst airlines""",2018-11-06,United Kingdom,"Hands down one of the worst airlines I've travelled with. We booked with Etihad because we made the assumption they were a premium airline with a high service level therefore worth the price. We were wrong. Budget airline service at premium prices. The outward leg of this journey from London-Singapore via Abu Dhabi was vastly worse than the return. The seats are very cramped. My seat was broken on both legs meaning I could not recline and when the person in front did, I was left with 6 inches between my face and their seat back. Both myself and my partner left both flights incredibly dehydrated - we had to ask multiple times for water (it is NOT acceptable to serve liquids only twice in 7 hours, especially not when you insist on filling the thimble sized cups only halfway). After asking a second time for liquids, the cabin crew ignored and subsequently turned off my partners request button before getting annoyed when he went to the galley to ask. To say the food was revolting is an understatement. No menus are provided on board and the staff do not describe the meal past ""chicken, lamb or vegetarian"". Dinner consisted of a rock hard bread roll, a bone dry cous cous 'salad' (not that there were any vegetables in it) and in my case some dry pasta with a small amount of tomato sauce and a dry cake - apparently vegetables are not part of the Etihad service. What a come down after having experienced food on Emirates or Malaysian Airlines! The snack comprised a hot pastry before we disembarked. Food on the second flight was no better - bland cold noodle salad then ""Spicy chicken noodles"" which was actually more slimy than spicy and a snack comprising a rock hard bread roll with a smear of mystery filling. The second leg from Abu Dhabi to Singapore was a source of greater annoyance as it was announced that we would be delayed AFTER they had boarded us, probably by an hour or something (90 minutes eventually sat without water). We had onward transport arranged and were trying to figure out if we would still make it. Questioning the passengers around us it turned out that our tickets all had different scheduled arrival times on them and the crew had no idea what our original landing time should have been. If you want extra snacks between meals then good luck - in line with budget carriers you have to pay extra for this! Given how much the flight tickets are, this has to be a joke. One wonders if this is why the food is so poor - to encourage people to buy extras. The entertainment system is another source of annoyance - endless advertisements and announcements which interrupt it for 5 minutes at a time. Screen pop ups advertising snacks or duty free are also extremely irritating. The system does not start up until you've been in the air for 30-40 minutes and then shuts down 40 mins to an hour before you land, mostly without warning. Charging for seats up until 24 hours before the flight departs also seems tight - some of the seats cost £60 to reserve. That's obscene. I discovered on the return leg (Singapore - Abu Dhabi - London) that delayed departures are so common for Etihad that their scheduled flight and arrival times are essentially meaningless, having spent another hour sitting on the tarmac at Abu Dhabi for no apparent reason.

Plus limited recline, circa 30 degrees from vertical, upon which when the person in the seat in front of you is reclined you have even less space to maneuver in and out and are pretty much forced to recline yourself to retain a semblance of spacing. Added to which the seat controls, such as they are, for recline, footrest, lumber massage are really stiff mechanical leavers (no electronic adjustment) so for example to recline push hard back on the lever then physically push the seat back. For a brand new plane absolutely abysmal! In addition there is literally no in flight entertainment system, at least in the seat backs. In business one is issued with an iPad which can stream movies etc. through the Silk Air WiFi. This does not support Internet connectivity, only the IFE. If you want to use your own device you need to have previously installed the Silk Air app from the app store - something nobody tells you before you board. In the cramped seat space there is very little place to put the iPad, even on the little plastic prop available on request, so one ends up holding it whilst also trying to juggle a meal or whatever. No noise cancelling headphones, just cheap in-ear buds issued and recovered, so I plugged my own noise cancellers in to the iPad. No capability to connect via Bluetooth of course. I found it impossible to doze let alone sleep on the 4.5 hours midnight flight so tried to pass the time with the limited selection of English language films on the iPad.

The seating has ample padding, but if you are seated in the first row, either side of the aircraft, you will find a lack of footrest, which can make it uncomfortable for a tall person - having that lack of footrest, causes an uncomfortable recline to the seat. Three of the four aircraft I flew on my trip, this was the case, with the one aircraft, being an upgraded model, had cubbies at the foot of the bulkhead, which you could stash a backpack and keep your feet there if you are tall. Also, sitting in the first row, means that your entertainment system is stashed in the armrests, which are always very warm, due to the systems being confined inside. Depending on an older or newer aircraft, will depend on whether your In-Flight entertainment system functions well. The pop-out drink tray at the front of the armrest section can and will get stuck, so you will then be lacking space for drinks, which can spill very easily on the above drink trays in front of the armrests.

In the rear economy cabin, under seats B, D and J you find big boxes for the inflight entertainment, under seats A, E, F and K you find huge ones. Only the G seats come with sufficient legroom. While the big boxes do reduce the legroom, the huge boxes leave only room for one foot (no room for the left foot under A and E seats, no room for the right foot under F and K seats). Didn't check the forward economy cabin, so maybe the position of the IFE boxes is a bit different. The boxes don't have sharp edges so you can put a foot on them. Besides, there are footrests installed, but only in front of the IFE boxes. So at every seat you find a misaligned footrest for only one of your feet, depending if the IFE box is on the right or left side of the seat in front of you. When folded up, the footrest bumps against you knee (also just one of your both) when the person in front of you reclines the seat.

On the A380, Row 42 is the second row from the front on the lower deck, meaning there is no middle set of seats, just the forward stairs going to the upper deck (business and first class seats). Also, being forward of the wing and engines mean it's a quieter part of the cabin. The seat width is sufficient for the 7 hour journey between London and Dubai.

In short this was the worst airline we have ever travelled on. Trip started well with a one up upgrade to premium economy and you can see why ANZ has done well in this category. However as we opted for the sky couch for the main leg you cannot bid for an upgrade and this is where ANZ really lets itself down. Pictures of the sky couch look very impressive however the truth is different. Dont know if they use tiny people but there is no way a small adult and 2 kids (of any age) can fit unto this space. Having 4 people in our family there was a need for another seat on the other side of the aisle. Economy seats for a so called international airline are the worst Ive ever seen. No width breadth or recline - simply terrible. Having to endure this on the return leg we decided to opt to bid for premium economy, however we had to give up a sky couch so that wasnt a tough decision. Saying that and having to endure the waiting timed via the customer service team who had on average a waiting time of 1 hour+ on 4 separate occassions, to place a bid because apparently no one ever had done this. Anyway our bid went through and the email confirmation stated that we'd hear 3 to 7 days prior if we'd be successful or not. When we heard nothing with 3 days to fo we called and were informed that we would now not hear anything till between 9 and 7 hours prior to the flight. With 7 hours to go we received an email stating we'd been unsuccessful and we'd lost the opportunity to rebook 2 sky couches (plan b) because we'd left it too late. Also due to protestors at LAX we were asked to arrive early because of potential disruptions. So resigned to the fact that we'd be flying back economy we were buoyed by the fact that our Auckland to Melbourne flight had been upgraded. However after arriving 4 hours early and dropping off the car we needed to walk 30 mins to the international airport. ANZ arent to blame for this of course, however the cabin crew were 3 hours late which is interesting considering they told us about the issue and all the passengers were on time. As a result connecting flights were missed, with no recompense in Auckland for those delayed. Our next flight was 8 hours later (currently writing this fron Auckland airport) and no airport lounge access was provided or upgrades given. To add in sult to injury we lost our premium economy upgrade, will need taxi fare to get home and have wasted a day of our lives.

While the leg room on the Air New Zealand Boeing 777-300 seemed reasonable, the 3x4x3 layout means the seats are very narrow and the aisles even narrower. The sky couch option is offered in one section of the three seat layout and really, you should think of it as buying the third seat for extra room. The couch works by a section of each of the three seats hinging upwards to fill in the gap between your seat and the back of those in front. Note that this feature means that when you’re not using the sky couch set-up, the seat design means the seat has no gap behind your calves so you can’t tuck your legs in. Also when you hinge the seats back down, then anything on the floor (like your shoes) is pushed below your seat and you can’t get to them! Going back to the use of the couch there are two main problems. The first we expected, in that if you’re over about 5 feet tall, you need to bend your legs to fit into the space you’re got. However the second was not really advertised, in that there’s simply not enough space for two people to lie down side by side. The problem is at your hips – we’re in our early fifties and I’d say normal sized adults by modern standards. However the very limited space means you really are crammed together – there’s no chance at all of moving around if one of you gets uncomfortable and there’s a real scramble to get up for a toilet visit – and it’s nearly impossible to get your temperature right. Add to that you’re lying across three seats (even with the thin mattress they give you) then there are bits sticking in you meaning two people have almost no chance of getting a long period of sleep. We actually had a little more success with one of us sitting up and the other using the two seat space. A previous reviewer commented that if the seat in front reclines then it really affects the space you have – we found this wasn’t really an issue if you also reclined your seats – effectively everything cancelled out. So at an extra cost of £299 to buy the spare seat to convert to a sky couch (on this flight – I assume it varies) then I’m not sure that it’s worth the extra cash, but it does buy you a spare seat for extra room.",Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3,November 2015,Couple Leisure,0.8,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.6,True,air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand,0.4,,,,,,,booked air new zealand sky couch experiment overnight flight try sleep due planned long drive landing leg room air new zealand boeing seemed reasonable layout mean seat narrow aisle even narrower sky couch option offered section three seat layout really think buying third seat extra room couch work section three seat hinging upwards fill gap seat back front note feature mean using sky couch set seat design mean seat gap behind calf tuck leg hinge seat back anything floor like shoe pushed seat get going back use couch two main problem first expected foot tall need bend leg fit space got however second really advertised simply enough space two people lie side side problem hip early fifty say normal sized adult modern standard however limited space mean really crammed together chance moving around get uncomfortable real scramble get toilet visit nearly impossible get temperature right add lying across three seat even thin mattress give bit sticking meaning two people almost chance getting long period sleep actually little success u sitting using two seat space previous reviewer commented seat front reclines really affect space found really issue reclined seat effectively everything cancelled extra cost buy spare seat convert sky couch flight assume varies sure worth extra cash buy spare seat extra room,"{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': 0.5768}",0.087,0.847,0.066,0.5768

While the Premium Economy price is considerably more than the economy we have willingly paid the difference for the comfort experienced on the long haul. Over the years we have experienced a variety of seating arrangements from the noticeable wider seats with more leg room to the ""moon seats"" which proved extremely uncomfortable and ultimately to the 777-200 flight which offered us the worst imaginable flight experience. The seats on our last trip to Queenstown and return were much narrower. We questioned our memory of past flights and finally checked the economy seats. Unfortunately economy seats did not look smaller than the premium economy. Our trip on January 4th this year to Queenstown found us on the long haul flight bumping elbows as we sat. There was no extra room to turn to choose a comfortable spot for sleeping. To use the phrase ""disappointing"" with reference to our latest trip and my own flight to Queenstown last May of 2014 is an understatement. The cost of our travel from Toronto to Queenstown was very close to $10000 for two adults. When advised by two friends who also traveled to Queenstown one week after us that their individual economy fares were in the region of $2500 each I am left wondering why so much was paid for so little. The premium economy accommodation would seem to be excessive in light of the meagre room afforded to your patrons of this class.
